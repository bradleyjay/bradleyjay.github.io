title: Lists

Python's basic collection data structure is the **List**. Much like an **Array**, a list is an ordered sequence of elements. Lists are mutable (they can be changed), and maybe most importantly, can store data of different types. For example here's a list named "box":

``` box = [5, True, [1,4], 42.5]```

Our list includes an **int**, **Bool**, *another* list, and a **float**. This flexibility means we can add items dynamically as our program progresses. 

In addition, we can reference a specific piece of data at a given index, or iterate through a list. A given operation can act on each element in order; let's define a list of numbers, and figure out which ones are even and which are odd. Using the **mod** operator (% in Python) will give us the remainder left after dividing by a given number. By choosing **mod 2**, we'll know which are odd by those that have non-zero values afterwards, like so: 

```python
numbers = [3 6 5 12 42]
for item in numbers:
  print(item%2)
  
 ```
 Which tells us only 3 and 5 are even:
 
 ```python
1
0
1
0
0
