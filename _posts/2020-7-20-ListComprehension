title: Lists and Memory
---

Let's tackle lists one last time. Scout's honor. For now. 

Creating lists with nested operations can get messy, as can working with large lists. So this time let's talk creating lists and memory. Remember lists? Yuk yuk.

Creating a list with nested operations gets used in a variety of ways, but let's try a filter here. If we wanted to add each element of two lists *only* if the second number was odd, we could inuitively write:

```python
a = ['Red ', 'Blue ', 'Yellow ']
b = ['Ball', 'House', 'Backpack']


for item in a:
    for element in b:
        print(item + element)
```
And get: 

```python
Red Ball
Red House
Red Backpack
Blue Ball
Blue House
Blue Backpack
Yellow Ball
Yellow House
Yellow Backpack
```

However, we can shorten this with a **list comprehension**. We can shorten the above code as:
