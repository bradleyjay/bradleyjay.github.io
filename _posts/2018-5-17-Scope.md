title: Scope Basics

Tripped on this today. Let's talk about scope! Python organizes scope as LEGB: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in. 

On to the example. This code doesn't work:

--------------------------

class Structure:
    
    structureName = None
    structureDescription = None
    
    def info(self):
        print("########   " + structureName + "  #########")
        print(structureDescription)
        
       
  greatHall = Structure()
  greatHall.info()
   
   
--------------------------
  
  
  The scope of info() includes structureName in the method, but does NOT include structureName at the **enclosing** level. So, it's out of scope. This is fixed by indicating where structureName actually is:
  
  
--------------------------
 
    def info(self):
        print("########   " + self.structureName + "  #########")
        print(self.structureDescription)
        
--------------------------

I initially thought this error had to do with a subclass, but including the **self** arguement in Structure.info() makes this work as well:

-------------------------

class Town_hall(Structure):
    
    structureName = "Town Hall"
    structureDescription = "Spawn workers from here!"


greatHall = Town_hall()
greatHall.info()
